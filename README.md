Q.1.The following questions are to enhance your understanding of basic concepts and definitions. You are expected to answer these questions on your own without referring to internet. [6 Marks]
a. State any four business applications of machine learning.                                       (0.5*4 = 2M)
Answer: - Please find below four business application of machine learning: -
1>	Medical Diagnosis
2>	Self-driving car
3>	Hand written digit recognition 
4>	Email spam detection
b. Explain the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning with example.                                                                                                                                           (1 M)
Answer: - Please find below difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning: - 
Supervised learning	Unsupervised learning
                     Input data is labelled 	                   Input data is Unlabelled
       Solve two types of problem statement
1-	Regression, 2- Classification 	       Solve two types of problem statement
1-	Clustering, 2- Dimensionality Reduction
 Dataset contains one dependent feature & one or multiple independent features	Dataset contains No dependent feature/attribute
Build /Fit a model that predict the output as accurately as possible based on independent features	To discover groups of similar examples with in data set.
Example: - Salary Prediction, Employability Prediction      	Example: - Customer segmentation based on their nature while visiting the store 

c. Provide differences between regression, classification, and clustering problems. Give an example where each of these models could be used.   
Answer: -
Regression Problem: - 
1-	Regression problem is type of supervised learning problem. 
2-	In Regression Problem where target/response variables take only continuous values.
3-	Types: - Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression & Multilinear Regression
4-	Example: - Prediction of used car price, House price prediction

Classification Problem: - 
1-	Classification problem is type of supervised learning problem. 
2-	In classification problem where target/response variables take discreate values.
3-	Example: - Employability Prediction, predicting whether a patient has a particular disease or not.
Clustering Problem: -
1-	Clustering problem is type of unsupervised learning problem.
2-	In clustering problem, we do clustering /grouping or customer segmentations within data set based on multiple independent features (Input).
3-	Example: - Customer segmentation based on their nature while visiting the store

Q.2.Solve the following matrix using simultaneous equations in python                              (2M)
                    6x+2y−5z=13,3x+3y−2z=13,7x+5y−3z=26

Answer: - Program submitted.
Q.3.The following dataset of size n = 63 provides total payment (in thousands) for all the claims of Swedish Kronor for geographical zones in Sweden. The variables are y = total payment in thousands and x = number of claims.
Find the intercept, coefficient value and error term for this regression problem.
How would you convey these numbers in a business context?          
Answer:-              
A fit model calculate model parameters values for above regression problem Intercept:19.994485759114855
Coefficient:3.4138235600663642
Error Term (Root Mean Squared Error): 35.94092182307428
 
•	In business context, this intercept value could represent fixed costs or other factors contributing to total payments, independent of the number of claims processed.
•	In a business context, this coefficient suggests that for each additional claim processed, total payments are expected to increase by approximately 3.41 units (thousands).
•	In a business context, the error term quantifies the accuracy of the regression model's predictions. A lower RMSE indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual total payments.
                                      (2+2 = 4M)
